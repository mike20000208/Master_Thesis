    1. The current probleem is that the RANSAC DOESN'T WORK!

    1. Looks like the distance threshold does effect the performance of RANSAC-based plane segmentation. 

    2. However, the RANSAC is really UNSTABLE!!!

    3. How to make RANSAC STABLE??????

    1. The reset situation seems to be random.

    1. One of the bugs is the type of coordinates. Should be double instead of integer. 

    2. Another bug is the round of the numbers, happening in the conversion from 3D space to pixel space.

    1. Trying to implement the KF. Stoppd at cellProject function. 

    2. Use 2D matrix to represent the info map in class My_Map instead of cv::Mat. 

    3. Therefore, also need to change renderingFromInfoMap function. 

    4. Create a new struct CellKF and class KF, but not really sure if the latter is 
        necessary or not.

    1. Complete the new map building with Kalman Filter. 

    2. Wait for test.....

    3. Also, maybe need to clean up the codes. 

    4. Also, try to discuss the details in the Kalman filter with Christian tomorrow. 

    5. Already complete the KF, generally. 

    6. However, some places still need to improvement or tune on. 

    7. For example, the time span between two updates. 

    8. For instance, the choice of sigma. 

    9. For example, the choice of the threshold of time span.

    1. The WFD cannot find any frontier right now. 

    2. Now, the WFD can find the frontier, but cannot keep updating it. 

    3. Need to read that paper again to know the principle.
